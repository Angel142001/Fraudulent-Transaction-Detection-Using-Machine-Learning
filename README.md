This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a large financial dataset with over 6 million records. The process began with extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which revealed that fraud is almost entirely concentrated in TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions. These fraudulent activities typically involved high transaction amounts and negative destination balance changes, signaling money being siphoned off. The dataset was extremely imbalanced (~0.1% fraud cases), so SMOTE was used to balance the classes. Further, statistical testing (t-tests, VIF) ensured the validity and non-redundancy of selected features.

Multiple models were built — including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM — with hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance. Among all, LightGBM emerged as the best-performing model, offering high precision and recall for the fraud class. These results demonstrate that the model can reliably detect high-risk transactions, making it a valuable tool for real-time fraud prevention in financial systems.
